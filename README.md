# Library-Management-System

Developed a system using Flask and MongoDB that streamlines book management operations such as adding, modifying, retrieving, racking, and lending books. This system integrates OpenCV and Pyzbar to enable real-time barcode scanning for quick book identification and tracking. Designed and implemented RESTful APIs to handle book and location data, ensuring seamless updates between collections (BookTable and LocationTable).
